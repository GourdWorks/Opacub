<h2> Summary </h2>

<p1> Meg is worried about Charles Wallace, who is bullied at school. Meg unsuccessfully tries to get Mr. Jenkins to help in protecting Charles Wallace against bullies. In the evening, Charles Wallace told Meg that he saw a drive of dragons in Sandy and Denys’ garden, after the walk to the garden, Charles Wallace got unusually tired. Charles Wallace, Calvin, and Meg eventually talked to a teacher named Blajeny and a Cherubim named Proginoskes about how they have three tasks, and have to stop the Echthroi, the source of darkness, war, and everything bad. Meg’s first task is to name Mr. Jenkins, as he has two Echthroi copies. After successfully doing so, the group finds out that the Echthroi is causing Charles Wallace’s illness. They go into one of Charles Wallace’s mitochondria and persuade Sporos, a young, undeepened farandola, to deepen, and help stop the Echthroi. While doing so, Meg is almost Xed by the Echthroi, and Proginoskes has to sacrifice himself to fill the emptiness in the Echthroi.
